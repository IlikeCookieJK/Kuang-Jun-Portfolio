                <h3>Western Dino House</h3>
                <p>Western Dino House was built to look like an actual fast food restaurant website. It was made with my
                    partner, Matthew. We spent a week making a layout of our website. Our next step was writing the HTML
                    for each pages. The last step for our project was working on the CSS, but we struggled with
                    positioning the contents in our website. Due to the fact that we lacked the skills, we spent a
                    majority of our time on CSS. Additionaly, we had some JavaScript file that we had to integrate into
                    our website. The file was given to us by our instructor and the purpose was to make the shopping
                    portion of our website functional.</p>
