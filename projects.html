                <h3>Battleship Unknown</h3>
                <p>This was a game that I created with my partner, Taha. We knew that we needed to make a game that was
                    compatible on desktop and mobile. In addition, the game needed the ability to allow people to play
                    with a friend or computer opponent. Hence why we chose to make a Battleship game with some twists.
                    The game mechanic is simple which made it easier for us to make a computer opponent. After we decided what game we wanted to make, we started by creating a layout of our game in Figma. We then moved on to making a turn flowchart and a program flowchart. </p>

                <h3>Western Dino House</h3>
                <p>Western Dino House was built to look like an actual fast food restaurant website. It was made with my
                    partner, Matthew. We spent a week making a layout of our website. Our next step was writing the HTML
                    for each pages. The last step for our project was working on the CSS, but we struggled with
                    positioning the contents in our website. Due to the fact that we lacked the skills, we spent a
                    majority of our time on CSS. Additionaly, we had some JavaScript file that we had to integrate into
                    our website. The file was given to us by our instructor and the purpose was to make the shopping
                    portion of our website functional.</p>
