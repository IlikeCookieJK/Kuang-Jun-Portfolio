                    <p>Battleship Unknown was a game that I created with my partner, Taha. We made a digitalize version
                        of Battleship where the ships are able to move and each ships with unique ability. We started
                        working on JavaScript first. Since we spent a majority of our time on JavaScript, we did not
                        spend enough time on the CSS. Overall the game function works, but the look would need more
                        improvement.</p>

                    <p>The Budget Calculator was created to help people calculated their monthly expenses. It helps with
                        calculating the deductions and monthly expenses from your net monthly income. The purpose of
                        this project is to learn how to
                        communicate and lead. We started with creating a prototype of our calculator in Figma. Then we
                        took turn leading someone or following someone instruction. This project provided practice with
                        communication and practicing teamwork.</p>

                    <p>Western Dino House was built to look like an actual fast food restaurant website. I made
                        it with my partner, Matthew. For this project, we started with creating a prototype. Then we
                        moved on to writing the HTML. Next we moved on to styling with CSS. While styling, we encounter
                        multiple challenges trying to positioning our contents.</p>

                    <h2>Battleship Unknown</h2>
                    <p class="truncate">This was a game that I created with my partner, Taha. We knew that we needed to
                        make a game that was compatible on desktop and mobile. In addition, the game needed the ability
                        to allow people to play with a friend or computer opponent. Hence why we chose to make a
                        Battleship game with some twists. The twists were ships being able to move each round, both
                        players don't know where their ships' locations are and each ship having their own unique
                        ability. The game mechanic is simple which made it easier for us to make a computer opponent.
                        After we decided what game we wanted to make, we started by creating a layout of our game in
                        Figma. We then moved on to Lucidchart where we made a turn flowchart and a program flowchart. A
                        flow chart allows us to visualize what happens when a
                        condition is met. Depending on what condition is met, there will be a different output. When we
                        finished with the flowcharts, we started programming the game logic with JavaScript. The reason
                        we wanted to work on JavaScript first is because we wanted to make the game work before we
                        worked
                        on the look of the game. There was a multiple roadblock we encountered working on the game
                        logic.
                        One of the major road block we encounter was preventing the ship coordinates from overlapping.
                        Our
                        solution was to create a loop that checked for the ship's coordinates with each other for any
                        that had the same. If it returned true, the ship would not move this round. The second to last
                        step
                        was to write the HTML and CSS. The final step was having people playing our game to give us
                        feedback
                        and find bugs. With feedbacks and bugs we made some quick fixes. Overall, this project has
                        taught me
                        the difficulty of time management.</p>

                        project is to learn how to communicate and lead. We started with creating a prototype of our
                        calculator in Figma. Then we were partner with someone every 25 minutes. Depending on the role
                        assigned, I would be leading someone on how to make my calculator or I would be working for
                        someone else. Either way, communication and teamwork was important, because we were not allowed
                        to write any of the code for our own calculator. Due to the restriction and a deadline, we
                        wanted our partner to work as efficiently as possible. After I finished my calculator, I
                        realized that I struggled with articulating instruction.</p>

                        HTML
                        for each pages. The last step for our project was working on the CSS, but we struggled with
                        positioning the contents in our website. Due to the fact that we lacked the skills, we spent a
                        majority of our time on CSS. Additionaly, we had some JavaScript file that we had to integrate
                        into
                        our website. The file was given to us by our instructor and the purpose was to make the shopping
