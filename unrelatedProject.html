            <h2>Paper Straw Rocket</h2>
            <p>This was a rocket I had to make for engineering class. I had to start with creating a model of my rocket
                in Fusion 360. Then I got to decide how my fins and nose of my rocket would look like. After I finished
                creating a model of my rocket, I had to start building it. The body of the rocket was a rolled up piece
                of paper. Some of the other part of the rocket like the nose and bulkhead were 3D printed. While the
                fins were laser cutted. The next part was assembling the parts. The last part was launching the rocket
                and collect data. Data that were collected was the velocity, distance traveled, and a estimated of how
                high it went.</p>

            <h2>Glaze Ceramic Bowl</h2>
            <p>This was my first ceramic project where I pratice how to pinch. I started with manipulating the clay into
                a sphere. Then I had to press my thumb into clay without going through the sphere. After my thumb left
                half an inch of clay from the bottom, I started pressing the clay outward in circular while rotating the
                clay. As I did this more the clay start resembling a bowl. When the bowl was formed, I added a foot to
                it, incised it for decoration, and it then got fired. After it got fired, it then got glazed and fired
                again.</p>

            <h2>Ceramic Whistle</h2>
            <p>In my ceramic class, we learned how to pinch and score clay. With these combined together, I was able
                create a clay whistle. I started with pinching the clay into two bowls with similar diameter. Then I
                scored the clay and blended the two bowl together. The next step was making a hole and attach a cylinder
                with a hole to the whistle. The last step was decorating the clay after it was fired.</p>
