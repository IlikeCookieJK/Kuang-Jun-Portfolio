                <h2>Blender Ship Model</h2>
                <p>These Blender ship models were something that my partner and I planned to add to our game, Battleship
                    Unknown. Unfortunatly we could not integrates these ship models into the game because we could not
                    figure out how to integrate the 3D model into the website. All these ship models took about three
                    days for me to learn how to use Blender and create the models. The biggest hurdle I dealt with was
                    trying to shape the ship's components. After working on the second ship model, I realized that I
                    could just make a seperate object for each ship's components. Overall, I enjoyed learning how to use
                    Blender and disappointed that we could not figure out how to implement the 3D models.</p>

                <h2>Paper Straw Rocket</h2>
                <p>This was a rocket I had to make for engineering class. I had to start with creating a model of my
                    rocket
                    in Fusion 360. Then I got to decide how my fins and nose of my rocket would look like. After I
                    finished
                    creating a model of my rocket, I had to start building it. The body of the rocket was a rolled up
                    piece
                    of paper. Some of the other part of the rocket like the nose and bulkhead were 3D printed. While the
                    fins were laser cutted. The next part was assembling the parts. The last part was launching the
                    rocket
                    and collect data. Data that were collected was the velocity, distance traveled, and a estimated of
                    how
                    high it went.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Glaze Ceramic Bowl</h2>
                <p>This was my first ceramic project where I pratice how to pinch. I started with manipulating the clay
                    into
                    a sphere. Then I had to press my thumb into clay without going through the sphere. After my thumb
                    left
                    half an inch of clay from the bottom, I started pressing the clay outward in circular while rotating
                    the
                    clay. As I did this more the clay start resembling a bowl. When the bowl was formed, I added a foot
                    to
                    it, incised it for decoration, and it then got fired. After it got fired, it then got glazed and
                    fired
                    again.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Ceramic Whistle</h2>
                <p>In my ceramic class, we learned how to pinch and score clay. With these combined together, I was able
                    create a clay whistle. I started with pinching the clay into two bowls with similar diameter. Then I
                    scored the clay and blended the two bowl together. The next step was making a hole and attach a
                    cylinder
                    with a hole to the whistle. The last step was decorating the clay after it was fired.</p>
