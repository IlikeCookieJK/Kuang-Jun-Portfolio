            <h2>Ceramic Whistle</h2>
            <p>In my ceramic class, we learned how to pinch and score clay. With these combined together, I was able
                create a clay whistle. I started with pinching the clay into two bowls with similar diameter. Then I
                scored the clay and blended the two bowl together. The next step was making a hole and attach a cylinder
                with a hole to the whistle. The last step was decorating the clay after it was fired.</p>
