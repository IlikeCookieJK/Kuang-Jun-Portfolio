            <p>I am Jun Kuang and I am going to graduate in 2024. I go to Buchanan High School. My favorite school
                subjects are math, world history, economics and computer science. During my free time, I like to play
                games and watch YouTube or anime. Some of my favorite games are League of Legends, Valorant and Azur
                Lane.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>My hobbies are playing video games and watching anime. My three favorite video games are League of
                    Legend, Azur Lane, and Valorant. What I like about League of Legends is the variety of champions
                    available for me to play and how they each have unique play style. Similarly, I enjoy Valorant
                    because
                    each agents have different abilities. While the reason I enjoy playing Azur Lane is because
                    its an amazing game for killing time.</p>

                <h2>My Favorite Subjects</h2>
                <p>My two favorite subjects are math and computer science. The reason these two are my favorite subjects
                    is
                    because I am able to find solutions with different methods. Although at time I do find them irrating
                    when I hit a wall.</p>

                <h2>Educational Background</h2>
                <p>I have gotten A's and B's throughout my high school years. During my junior year, I did engineering
                    in
                    the Center of Advance Research and Technology (CART). In the Engineering lab, I learned how to use
                    Fusion 360 and physics. During my senior year, I did Web Application, where I learned how to code.

                <h2>Club</h2>
                <p>During my time at CART I have learned how to code and joined a club. Using the new coding knowledge,
                    I
                    have created websites. One of the websites was used for a public showcase at CART. The club I joined
                    was
                    the CART Esport club. In the club, we played games and participated in a tournament between other
                    Esport
                    clubs from Fresno.</p>
