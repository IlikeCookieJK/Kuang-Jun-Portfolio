            <p>I am Jun Kuang and I am going to graduate in 2024. I go to Buchanan High School. My favorite school
                subjects are math, world history, economics and computer science. My plan for the future is to pursue
                further education in computer science at Clovis Community College. Then I plan to transfer to UC Merced
                to finish my education and get a Bachelor of Computer Science Degree.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>My hobbies are playing video games and watching anime. My three favorite video games are League of
                    Legend, Azur Lane, Valorant, and TFT. What I like about League of Legends is the variety of
                    champions
                    available for me to play and how they each have unique play style. Similarly, I enjoy Valorant
                    because
                    each agents have different abilities. While the reason I enjoy playing Azur Lane is because
                    its an amazing game for killing time.</p>

                <h2>My Favorite Subjects</h2>
                <p>My two favorite subjects are math and computer science. The reason these two are my favorite subjects
                    is
                    because I am able to find solutions with different methods. Although at time I do find them irrating
                    when I hit a wall.</p>

                <h2>Educational Background</h2>
                <p>I have gotten A's and B's throughout my high school years. During my junior year, I did engineering
                    in
                    the Center of Advance Research and Technology (CART). In the Engineering lab, I learned how to use
                    Fusion 360 and physics. During my senior year, I did Web Application, where I learned how to code.

                <h2>Club</h2>
                <p>At CART, I joined an Esport club where we played Overwatch. On Monday, we would meet up to hang out
                    and play game together. While on Wednesday, we would compete against other Fresno Esport club.
                    Additionally, I competed in the fall and spring tournament. The competition was better and my team
                    did not make it far.</p>
